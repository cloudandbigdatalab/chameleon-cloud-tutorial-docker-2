# chameleon-cloud-tutorial-docker-2

**Tutorial Under Development**

Topics:
- Docker Machine
- Docker Compose

Ideas so far:
- Can very clearly see how to use Compose to wrap up what we did in the first tutorial in a nice package. I think this is a definite.
- Could use Machine as part of this but I don't see how that really emphasises what Machine is all about.
- I think for machine I'd like to see about plugging that into Chameleon APIs. I'm not sure about that.
