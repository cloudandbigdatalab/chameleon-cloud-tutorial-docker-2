**Tutorial Under Development**

This tutorial will cover using Docker Machine and Compose.

Machine:
I think I want to have them spin up multiple Chameleon servers then show them how to use Docker on them via Machine rather than SSH'ing to each Chameleon host. So basically just simplifying your workflow if all your using is Docker.

Compose:
I want to take what I did in the first tutorial and wrap that up with Compose. That seems like a good idea. In the first part I had all the separate Docker files and then you strung it together with commands. So now I can show how to streamline what we already did.

I'm not sure how or if I want to relate these two more together. I think I could get them setup with Machine then have the Compose script interface with that. I think that's possible but not sure.
